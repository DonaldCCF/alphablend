# FactorGene

FactorGene is an innovative project inspired by `gplearn` and built with `sklearn`. It aims to generate factors through a genetic algorithm to mine high information coefficient factors that capture stock movements effectively.

## Features

- Utilizes Genetic Algorithms for factor creation
- Integrates with `sklearn` for an accessible and efficient experience
- Targets high information coefficient factors to understand and predict stock movements

## How it Works

FactorGene operates by applying genetic algorithms to historical stock data, optimizing the generation of factors to predict future stock movements. The diagram below outlines the basic workflow:
